The Game of Pig is a classic game played with a 6 sided die. In the game a player rolls the die. If they roll a 2 through 6, they add that score to their round score, but if they roll a 1, their round is over and their round score resets to zero.

At any point, the player can choose to bank their round score. When they do that, the points are added to their overall score and their round score resets back to zero.

Once the playerâ€™s overall score reaches 100, they win. While the die roll is random, there is a little strategy when deciding whether to bank or continue in the round. If you try to be a pig and get more points, you may lose everything and have to start over!
